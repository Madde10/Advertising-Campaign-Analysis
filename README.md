# Advertising-Campaign-Analysis

Background: A prominent travel agency has conducted an advertising campaign. Two datasets - ’Abandoned.
csv’ (ABD) and ’Reservation.csv’ (RES) - provide insights into customer interactions and outcomes
from this campaign.

Objective: Determine the statistical success of a retargeting campaign by matching and analyzing the
datasets.

Introduction
’Abandoned.csv’ contains data about customers who engaged but didn’t purchase a vacation package.
Notice the potential missing data and duplicates. These customers were divided into test and control
groups for a retargeting campaign. ’Reservation.csv’ documents customers who eventually purchased
vacation packages.

Task: Establish whether the retargeting campaign was statistically effective.
